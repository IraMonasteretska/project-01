                        They don’t like too much stimulation.
                        And they don’t like too many things happening at once. What they do like is simple,
                        sophisticated,
                        and feeling confident in their own skin. But the online space today is filled with people
                        talking
                        about confidence. There is a lot of noise surrounding that word. It's almost like everybody
                        wants to
                        teach everybody about what it means to be confident. But the kind of confidence they talk about
                        is
                        often shallow, fragile, and at risk of disappearing at any time.

                                Because the definition of confidence you have has failed you. Confidence isn’t something
                                you arbitrarily “lose.” It’s usually the result of years of living in misalignment with
                                your true self. It’s an attempt to cope with a world that’s too different from you by
                                burying your quiet, sensitive nature and being just like everyone else. Now you might
                                tell me that colour is too miscellaneous. How can merely doing a colour consultation
                                change how you feel about yourself and the world? The important thing here is you're not
                                changing anything. You’re merely going back to your origin.
                            </p>

                                Getting your colour palette done will feel like coming home. The process would be
                                comfortable and feel GOOD for you. By the end of it, you'll be effortlessly confident.
                                Effortlessly exuding elegance and grace and charm. Because you have that within you. You
                                just don't know how attractive you can be yet. You're not aware of your power. By
                                expressing yourself through your colours / clothes, you will assert your place in the
                                world. Your very soul will be seen. Others will respect you from the very first
                                impression. We only have so much time to live and not all people can take the time to
                                reverse their first image impression of you.

                        When you first hear the word colour, you think of light. But close your eyes for a second and
                        what do you see? A myriad of brilliant colours dancing in front of you, like a kaleidoscope.
                        Even in a dark room, you’d still see a world of colours, many of which would be impossible to
                        reproduce in hysical reality. Colour is far, far more than a mere visual delight. In fact, it
                        has been telling us something important about ourselves throughout aeons of evolution. But in an
                        underlying manner. Because colour is all about feelings, and feelings are subtle.
                        As a sensitive woman, you are far more capable of grasping this subtleness. You dream in colour,
                        you visualise in colour, you imagine in colour. So knowing how colour affects you will make you
                        think more carefully about every decision you make in your daily life.

                                        Colour analysis considers your physical colouring. The skin acts as a filter and
                                        the tone lies just under the surface. Knowing the skin tone will enable you to
                                        wear your best colours, more exactly the shade and intensity of the colour that
                                        suits you most. Everyone can wear almost any colour. The correct colour analysis
                                        will give you your very individual colour spectrum. You will know which colours
                                        to wear, which ones to avoid and what Season you are.

                                        Colour psychology allows for the understanding of personality types and their
                                        response to colours. We are all unique individuals, yet there are recognisable
                                        patterns of typical behaviour and characteristics which are clearly defined.
                                        Knowing and understanding your behaviour and traits permits ultimately your
                                        understanding of self and of others.
